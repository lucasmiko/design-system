# Design System

This repository contains a project developed as part of a Design System course using TypeScript.

## Course Overview

The Design System course focused on the principles and best practices of building and maintaining a design system. Through this course, students learned about the importance of consistent and reusable design components and how to implement them using TypeScript.

## Features

- **Design System**: Understand the concept and benefits of a design system.
- **TypeScript**: Utilize TypeScript to build a design system.
- **Reusable Components**: Create reusable UI components with consistent design patterns.
- **Component Documentation**: Include documentation for each component, describing their usage and properties.

## Prerequisites

Before working on the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org
